# SunPy: coding to analyse signals from the Sun

SunPy walkthrough | Session W1005 at SeptembRSE 2021.

The SunPy library provides various modules for the conversion and transformation of electromagnetic signals emitted from the Sun. It is widely used among astrophysical research communities. However, it is also a valuable tool to experiment with high-volume data. In this walkthrough, I will demonstrate some common ways to explore these solar data resources.
