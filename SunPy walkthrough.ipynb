    "The SunPy library provides various modules for the conversion and transformation of electromagnetic signals emitted from the Sun. It is widely used among astrophysical research communities. However, it is also a valuable tool to experiment with high-volume data. In this walkthrough, I will demonstrate some common ways to explore these solar data resources."
